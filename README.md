## Description

Was tasked to create a command-line application that would prompt the user with questions and with the information provided by the user, the application would then dynamically generate a professional ReadMe file.

## Installation
Node Modules and Bootstrap css

## Usage Info

## Skills Implemented
Node.js, HTML, Bootstrap css, Javascript, Node Modules

## Lessons Learned
I really thought I was going to struggle a bit more than I did with this challenge, really just because we were doing everything through an integrated terminal. Installing NPM modules and running the javascript code through the terminal seemed a bit intimidating at first.
However, It was a bit easier than I thought once I had gotten started. I did run into a issue when trying generate the license badges and license terms, as well as the linking of my github account once the file becomes generated. Aside from the struggles, I did find it very satisfying 
that I was able to trouble shoot some basic problems and then build out everything I need to build as far as HTML structure and then implemented the bootstrap design to the structure. Its not as refined as I wanted but its a step in the righ ttdirection.
